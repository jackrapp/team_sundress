Day 1: The Plan - We decided to revisit our first project "Chicago Crime" with the goal of redeemimg ourselves.
Deciding visualizations was no brainer because any visualization we come with that can be completed with accuracy
is better than what we present the first time. My assignment is to create a heat map so I used this opportunity to 
redo some of our class lessons.

Day 2: found some fun custom icons images to represent types of crime. I wrote my javascript code. 
Try to run and it failed over and over and over again. The end.

Day 3: The struggle is real and swear words are flying. Time to call a TA.

Day 4: Now I'm cooking with gas. The biggest challenge today is data is too big. program keeps crashing. 
        Data now has been paired down to top 5 crimes. Now it finally runs without timing out.

Day 5: added favicon played with zoom. Completed and ready to show off!
